About
=====
This is a 8-bit CPU I designed.

I realise the circuit in Multisim. The CPU can run a simple program in 6116 RAM whose initial content is written by a 8052 chip.

TEST
====
There is a test program I use to run it on my TTL CPU, its function is to calculate the sum value from 1 to 19. 

I made a screen-shot on the result it gives: 1011 1110 (Dec. 190).
